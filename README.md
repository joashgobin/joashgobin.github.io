# Mango CSS
This CSS project is based on CUBE CSS (https://cube.fyi) - a CSS methodology that prioritizes working with the strengths of CSS, not against them.

The project also uses SwupJS (https://swup.js.org) for page transitions and the CSS files cater for the transition states that SwupJS imposes on the HTML.
